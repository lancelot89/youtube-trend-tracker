feat: Add duration, content details, and topic details to video data

This commit extends the video data fetching and storage capabilities to include:
- Video duration in seconds (`duration_sec`)
- Content details as JSON string (`content_details`)
- Topic details as string array (`topic_details`)

Key changes include:
- Modified `internal/youtube/client.go` to fetch new fields and parse duration.
- Updated `internal/storage/bq.go` to reflect new schema and handle emulator connection.
- Adjusted `internal/fetcher/fetcher.go` to map new fields.
- Refactored `cmd/fetcher/main.go` for flexible local execution.
- Updated `Refactoring.md` with the latest project plan.
- Added `work_log_20250812.md` to document the implementation and verification process.

The BigQuery schema has been updated to accommodate these new fields.
Verification was performed against a BigQuery emulator, confirming successful data ingestion and field population.
